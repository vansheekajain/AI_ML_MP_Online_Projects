PPO CartPole-v1 Reinforcement Learning
Name: Vansheeka Jain

Registration Number: 23BCE11023

Application Number: IN26011061

Batch Number: 1A

This project implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to solve the Gymnasium CartPole-v1 environment using Stable-Baselines3.

Project Structure
train.py - Script to initialize the environment, train the PPO agent, and save training logs.
evaluate.py - Evaluates the trained model over 100 test episodes to log deterministic performance metrics.
test.py - Renders a live visual window showing the trained model balancing the pole.
ppo_model.zip - Saved policy network weights.
learning_curve.png - Training performance graph showing reward progression.
evaluation_report.txt - Text document tracking final evaluation results.
Installation & Setup
Create and activate a clean Conda environment:
conda create -n my_env python=3.10 -y
conda activate my_env

2. **Install the required packages:**
*(Note: Quotes around `stable-baselines3[extra]` are required for macOS Zsh compatibility to avoid pattern matching errors).*
```bash
pip install "stable-baselines3[extra]" gymnasium matplotlib

How to Run
Execute the scripts in the following order to generate your deliverables:

1. Train the Agent
Runs the PPO agent for 50,000 timesteps, saves the model checkpoint, and generates the training progress chart.

python train.py
2. Evaluate Performance
Tests the saved checkpoint over 100 separate episodes and writes the performance numbers into a clean text report.

python evaluate.py
3. Visual Testing
Launches a live visual rendering window on your Mac screen to watch the trained model in action.

python test.py
